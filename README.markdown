# Embeddable Page

Allows you to add a page type `embeddable` to a symphony page in order to allow embedding in an iFrame via `X-Frame-Options â€”> ALLOWALL`.

## Acknowledgements

Many thanks to [Jonathan Mifsud](https://github.com/jonmifsud) for initial code! I also butchered the `maintenance_mode` extension in order to built this.
